# Basic React App Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate containing the general structure & tools I commonly use for most of my React projects.

It comes with:

* redux/rematch for state
* react-router for client side routing
* parcel as bundler & dev server
* most common babel transforms & plugins
* the react eslint config (used by CRA)
* jest for testing
* my default folder structure

## Get Started

Simply `yarn && yarn start` to install everything and run the dev server.
